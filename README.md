# form_generator
I'm taking a Typography elective this semester and am feeling very inspired by the 
intricacy of type. I wanted to play around with the form of the word curiosity.I created
three interactions that are looped so that the program comes back to the first interaction
after the third and so on. The first one is pretty simple with the word "curiosity" 
following the mouse position on the canvas.The second one was more complicated because 
I needed to keep track of each letter in the word. I wanted to demonstrate "curiosity" as 
a sum of it's parts. Hence, every time you hover over a certain letter, another word will show 
up at random positions of the screen. This word contains only the letters of "curiosity." I 
randomized the colors of the additional words while fading out the letters in "curiosity" 
that weren't used to demonstrate the correlation. The third one was similar to the first 
except it is one letter at a time. I wanted to break down the word to explore it's 
structure in the barest form.
